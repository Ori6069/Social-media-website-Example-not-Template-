# Social-media-website-Example-not-Template-
An easy simple HTML and JS code for a website to publish posts and images. (Just like social media) :)

# How to setup?
1. Get Supabase and create an account if you don't have one.

2. The URL under your project name is important so keep it, because you will need to put in the code here:

3. For the ANON key, go to Project Settings.
4. Go to API, then select "Legacy ANON". And thats your ANON key. Place it in your code. Now lets work on the uploading functionality. (Note: name everything excatly as shown if your a beginner in HTML and JS).

7. As you can see here, I already made 2 policies so make them. Press create policy. (Name them exactly the same)

9. Now we need a place to store all the posts, so on the sidebar go to storage, then create a new bucket. Name excatly as shown.

10. Make it a public bucket but pressing on the toggle switch. (You can set a file limit on the posts people upload if you want to by toggling the file limit switch and setting a limit in Mb)
## Thats it! Congrats on your social media website!! :)
